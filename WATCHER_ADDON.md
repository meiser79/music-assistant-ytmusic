# Provider Watcher Add-on

When Home Assistant restarts, the Supervisor recreates the MA container from its image, wiping any files you copied into it, including this provider. The watcher add-on solves this by automatically re-copying the provider files whenever the MA container is recreated.

---

## How it works

The add-on polls the MA container ID every 10 seconds. When the Supervisor recreates the MA container (new ID), the watcher copies the provider files into the new container and restarts MA so it picks up the fresh files. On first startup, the watcher also installs the provider immediately if MA is already running.

The provider files are baked into the watcher image at build time, so there is no dependency on `/config` volume mapping at runtime.

Optionally, the watcher can also keep the provider **up to date**: enable `auto_update` (opt-in, off by default) and it periodically fetches the latest provider from GitHub, then reinstalls + restarts MA **only when the code actually changed** (SHA-256 comparison). See [Auto-update](#auto-update) below.

## config.yaml

```yaml
name: "MA Provider Watcher"
description: "Re-installs the ytmusic provider into Music Assistant after every container restart."
version: "2.0.0"  # the installer stamps a fresh "2.0.0.<timestamp>" on each run so HA detects the change
slug: ma_provider_watcher
init: false
boot: auto
docker_api: true
arch:

  - i386
options:
  auto_update: false
  update_interval_hours: 24
schema:
  auto_update: bool
  update_interval_hours: int(1,)
```

The `options`/`schema` block exposes the [Auto-update](#auto-update) settings in the add-on's **Configuration** tab. `update_interval_hours` is in hours and clamped to a minimum of 1 at runtime. A `translations/en.yaml` file gives the fields friendly names and descriptions instead of the raw keys:

```yaml
# translations/en.yaml
configuration:
  auto_update:
    name: Keep the ytmusic provider up to date
    description: >-
      Off by default. When enabled, periodically check GitHub for a newer
      ytmusic provider and reinstall it (restarting Music Assistant) only
      when the code actually changed. Note this downloads and runs branch-head
      code inside Music Assistant unattended. This is NOT the add-on's own "Auto
      update" control on the Info tab, which updates the watcher add-on itself;
      this option updates the music provider.
  update_interval_hours:
    name: Check the provider for updates every (hours)
    description: >-
      How often to check GitHub for a newer provider, in hours. 24 = once a
      day, 168 = weekly, 1 = hourly. Minimum 1 hour.

```

> **Note:** Supervisor renamed add-on containers from `addon_*` to `app_*`, so the right value for `MA=` depends on your Supervisor version. Check with:
> ```bash
> docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep music_assistant
> ```
> The `run.sh` the installer generates re-detects this at runtime and adapts if the name it was given is not there, which is what stops a future rename silently disabling the watcher (issue #54). The minimal `run.sh` above does not, so if you hand-write it, keep the `MA=` line correct yourself.

> **Note:** The `python3.13` in `DST=` tracks MA's Python version, which changes over time (recent Music Assistant builds use `python3.14`). The installer auto-detects it; if you edit `run.sh` by hand, set it to match.
> Check with: `docker exec "$MA" ls /app/venv/lib/`

> **Note:** The `run.sh` above is the minimal core (re-inject after container recreation). The `run.sh` that the installer generates additionally implements [Auto-update](#auto-update): it reads `auto_update`/`update_interval_hours` from `/data/options.json`, fetches the latest provider tarball into a `/data` cache, and reinstalls only when the SHA-256 changes.

## Quick install (recommended)

For most users the [`scripts/install_watcher_addon.sh`](scripts/install_watcher_addon.sh) installer handles steps 1-3 below automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/main/scripts/install_watcher_addon.sh | sh
```

The script is POSIX `sh` (works on HAOS BusyBox `ash`), uses `curl + tar` instead of `git`, auto-detects the local add-ons path (HAOS `apps/local` and legacy `addons/local`, Supervised, and the in-add-on `/addons` mapping), and tries to detect the MA container ID and Python venv version. After it finishes, jump to [step 4 (Install the add-on)](#4-install-the-add-on) below.

> **Re-running the installer? Rebuild the add-on.** The provider files and `run.sh` are baked into the add-on image at build time. If the add-on is already installed and you re-run the script (for example to fix `--python-version` or `--ma-id`), Home Assistant keeps the cached image until you rebuild it: open the add-on → three-dot menu → **Rebuild**, then **Start**. The installer stamps a fresh version on every run so "Check for updates" flags the change, but a cached image is only replaced by a rebuild.
>
> **Getting the new options after an upgrade from a version without them:** the Supervisor caches a local add-on's config schema at install time. If you had an older watcher installed (before these options existed), a Rebuild alone won't surface the new **Configuration** fields; the schema is only re-read on an **update**. Do **Check for updates**, then **Update** the add-on (three-dot menu), and the `auto_update` / `update_interval_hours` fields appear. This is the normal add-on-update flow (no console commands needed). A fresh install shows them immediately.

Common flags:
- `--force`: overwrite an existing install without prompting
- `--ref REF`: pin to a branch, tag or commit instead of the newest release. `--ref main` tracks branch head, which is what the installer used to do by default
- `--ma-id ID` / `--python-version pythonX.Y`: override auto-detection
- `--addons-dir DIR`: skip path auto-detection (useful for non-standard installs)

Run `sh install_watcher_addon.sh --help` to see all options.

> **Passing flags through `curl | sh`:** if you re-run the one-liner with a flag, use `sh -s --` as a separator so the flag goes to the script and not to `sh` itself:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/main/scripts/install_watcher_addon.sh | sh -s -- --force
> ```
>
> `curl ... | sh --force` parses `--force` as a shell option and fails with `sh: bad option '--force'`.

> **Auto-detection caveats:** the MA container ID and Python version are detected via `docker ps` / `docker exec`, which requires running the script from a host shell with Docker access (e.g. the SSH & Web Terminal add-on with Protection Mode off, or the host shell on a Supervised install). If detection fails, the script falls back to `app_d5369777_music_assistant` and `python3.13` and prints a warning, so verify and re-run with `--ma-id` / `--python-version` if those defaults are wrong for your install. A wrong container name is now recoverable on its own: the generated `run.sh` re-detects at startup and whenever the configured name goes missing, and logs that it has adapted. A wrong Python version is not, so that one is worth checking.

## Manual installation

### 1. Create the add-on directory

Open the Terminal add-on and create the directory structure. The path depends on your HA installation type:

| Installation | Local add-ons path |
|---|---|
| **HAOS 18+** | `/mnt/data/supervisor/apps/local/` |
| **HAOS (older)** | `/mnt/data/supervisor/addons/local/` |
| **Supervised** | `/usr/share/hassio/apps/local/` (older: `/usr/share/hassio/addons/local/`) |
| **Inside the SSH / Samba add-on** | `/addons/` |

> Home Assistant renamed the Supervisor `addons` tree to `apps` (HAOS 18+, the same rename behind `ha apps` replacing `ha addons`). On upgrade the Supervisor migrates existing local add-ons from `addons/local` to `apps/local`. From the HAOS host console, find yours with `find /mnt/data/supervisor -maxdepth 3 -type d -name local`.

```bash
# HAOS 18+ (host console)
mkdir -p /mnt/data/supervisor/apps/local/ma_provider_watcher

# Inside the SSH / Samba add-on
mkdir -p /addons/ma_provider_watcher
```

### 2. Copy the provider files

Copy the `ytmusic` provider folder into the add-on directory (use whichever
path matches your shell from the table above: `/addons/...` inside the SSH/Samba
add-on, or the `/mnt/data/supervisor/...` host path from the HAOS console):

```bash
# Inside the SSH / Samba add-on
cp -r /path/to/ytmusic /addons/ma_provider_watcher/ytmusic
```

### 3. Create the add-on files

Create `config.yaml`, `build.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, and `run.sh` as shown above.

<a id="4-install-the-add-on"></a>
### 4. Install the add-on

In Home Assistant: **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store** (three-dot menu) → **Check for updates**. The **MA Provider Watcher** appears under **Local add-ons**. Click → **Install**.

### 5. Disable Protection Mode

Go to the add-on's **Info** tab and turn **Protection mode OFF**. This is required. Without it, the Docker socket is not mounted and the add-on cannot manage MA containers.

### 6. Start and verify

Start the add-on and check the logs. You should see:

```
Docker OK
MA running (...), installing provider...
Copied OK
MA restarted
Polling for MA container changes every 10s...
```

---

## Updating the provider

When you update the `ytmusic` provider code, copy the new files into the add-on directory and rebuild (path as in the table above: `/addons/...` inside the SSH/Samba add-on):

```bash
cp -r /path/to/ytmusic /addons/ma_provider_watcher/ytmusic
ha apps rebuild local_ma_provider_watcher
ha apps restart local_ma_provider_watcher
```

Or let the watcher do it for you, see [Auto-update](#auto-update).

---

<a id="auto-update"></a>
## Auto-update

The watcher can keep the provider current on its own, so you don't have to manually copy files and rebuild every time `ytmusic` changes upstream.

### Options

Set these in the add-on's **Configuration** tab (or `options` in `config.yaml`):

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto_update` | bool | `false` | Off by default (opt-in). When on, the watcher periodically checks GitHub for a newer provider and reinstalls it. Note it then runs branch-head code inside MA unattended. Leave off to pin to the version baked into the image. |
| `update_interval_hours` | int (hours) | `24` | How often to check. `24` = daily, `168` = weekly, `1` = hourly. Clamped to a minimum of `1` at runtime; invalid values fall back to the default. |

Auto-update follows **published releases** by default: it re-resolves the newest release before every check, so a release published after you installed is picked up. Installing with `--ref` pins that instead, and the watcher then follows exactly what you asked for, whether that is a branch head, a tag or a commit.

### How it works

1. On startup (and every `update_interval_hours` hours thereafter), the watcher resolves the newest release (unless pinned with `--ref`) and downloads that provider tarball from GitHub into a cache under `/data`.
2. It compares the SHA-256 of the fetched `ytmusic/` against what's already cached.
3. **Only if the code changed**, it copies the new files into the MA container and restarts MA. Unchanged fetches are a no-op, so no needless restarts.
4. If a fetch fails (offline, GitHub down), the watcher logs a warning and keeps using the currently installed version. It never leaves MA without a provider. A release lookup that fails is the same: it keeps using the last one it knows about rather than falling back to branch head behind your back.

Once a newer version has been cached, it also survives MA container recreation: the watcher installs from the cache in preference to the image-baked copy.

### Logs

With auto-update active you'll see lines such as:

```
provider source: /data/ytmusic
auto-update: new provider version detected -> reinstalling
```

If `auto_update` is `false`, the watcher behaves exactly as before (re-inject on container recreation only).

## Troubleshooting

**`ERROR: No Docker socket (is Protection Mode off?)`**
- Turn **Protection mode OFF** in the add-on settings. This is the most common issue.

**`lstat /provider: no such file or directory`**
- The `ytmusic/` folder is missing from the add-on directory. Copy it and rebuild.

**`could not find local add-ons directory. Pass --addons-dir explicitly.`**
- The installer probed the known locations and none existed in your shell. Most often this is HAOS 18+, where the path moved from `addons/local` to `apps/local`.
- From the HAOS host console, locate it: `find /mnt/data/supervisor -maxdepth 3 -type d -name local`, then re-run with `--addons-dir /mnt/data/supervisor/apps/local`.
- Inside the SSH / Samba add-on the path is usually `/addons`, so re-run with `--addons-dir /addons`.

**Add-on not found in store**
- Ensure `config.yaml` and `build.yaml` are valid YAML. Check Supervisor logs: `ha supervisor logs | grep ma_provider`.
- Run `ha supervisor reload` and wait 30 seconds.

**Provider still missing after HA restart**
- Check the watcher logs for `cp failed` or `restart failed` errors.
- Confirm the MA container name matches `MA=` in `run.sh`.

**`cp failed` with `Could not find the file /app/venv/lib/pythonX.Y/...`, or re-running the installer changes nothing**
- The add-on is running a cached image with the old `run.sh` (wrong Python version or MA ID baked in). Re-running the installer updates the files on disk but not the running image.
- Rebuild the add-on: open it → three-dot menu → **Rebuild**, then **Start** (or `ha apps rebuild local_ma_provider_watcher && ha apps restart local_ma_provider_watcher`).
- Confirm the Python version MA actually uses with `docker exec <ma-id> ls /app/venv/lib/`, and re-run with `--python-version pythonX.Y` if it differs.
